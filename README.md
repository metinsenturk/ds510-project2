# Patient Heart Disease
Constructing a model from a number of factors to determine a given patient will have a heart disease.

## First Approach
We will construct a logistic regression to train our model with the train dataset. Then, we will be testing our model on the remaining part of the dataset and we will be providing our findings on how to measuring the our model. 
## Second Approach
Last of the model, we will use support vector machine to train our model and provide our findings on the accuracy of the model.
